If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0 and you get the following error

"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\INCLUDE\intrin.h(26) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'ammintrin.h': No such file or directory"

you may copy the header file on this folder into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\INCLUDE\" and the problem might be solved.
